Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

 

Example 1:

Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.
Example 2:

Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
 

Constraints:

1 <= haystack.length, needle.length <= 104
haystack and needle consist of only lowercase English characters.

class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        // Handle the case where needle is an empty string
        if (needle.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Find the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack
        int index = haystack.indexOf(needle);
        return index; // This will return -1 if needle is not found
    }
}
